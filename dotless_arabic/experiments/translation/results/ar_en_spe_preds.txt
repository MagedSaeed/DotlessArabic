I'm going to talk to you today about the history of geometric
That's a very large thing to do in the 18-minute-minute
It's a complicated, complicated place, we'll go to New Hampshire, New Jersey, so we're straight to the place
Because I was 30 years old, I was living in a room called Nellon Mandela, and I was living there with my father, and I was living in this city called Nichols, 30 years ago
When my sister was in the corner there with my brother's room with my sister's sister
And my living room there was a living chamber and the Millennium Develope
And there's a place where everybody's in the bathroom, so every time I go to the TV, everybody would watch my room, and everybody would see my eyes, and so everybody would go to the bathroom and watch my house, and
I looked like this
I was frustrated, and I hate that, I don't feel guilty, I felt like this one
I hate that room, I hate that house, and I hate that porch
And that's architecture
And he ended up
That's not the power of architecture, because those are the places that we're feeling, and it's the kind of architecture that we're bringing in architecture, that's the sense of architecture, it's the way that we're feeling
Nine percent of Americans spend time protecting their environment, because it's so weird to protect them from the environment, because it's 90 percent of American times
I mean, it's 90 percent of our times we've been surrounded by Indian times
That's a huge thing
What does it mean for us to be aware of geometry in ways that we weren't allowed to be in realistic
So what we want is something that makes us very easily predictable, and we can predict what we're going to do
"This is what you're going to think about when you're going to think about: "This is a building of power," which means "I know about democracy," and I think of power and thinking
I know you've been thinking about it since we're building on the basis of Greeks, because it's 250 years ago, by the way of building Greece
Here's the trickster
This is the material that we build for you to have to use to link up with the fences that we're using to build on the radioactive-on-sensing
It's a very emotional, and it's been used for a very long time, in a long time
We've been doing it for about 200 years to build our cinema
So we took it into the 19th century to build the artworks
And in the 20th century, we use it to build the homes of the U.S. in the U.S.
Look at those young soldiers, the passenger to the surroundings, and look at the passengers and take back to the bottom of the ground to take care of the young people
That's a really useful thing. Because the building is a playful thing
It's very complicated, it's a very complicated demand, and it requires a lot of time
It's better than you're going to be able to build these forms -- these are things that they're using -- they're going to do natural, and they're just going to build things that are going to take advantage of the things that are going
So we've got to get buildings like this, at the end, at the end, like this
It's a beautiful tool
This is the thing that says to me: you know, I'm going to be able to stand up in my office in the High Line of Princeton, and I've got the Mall of the Moon of the C.U.
But it doesn't have a lot to do with the librarians that are doing today today
On the other side of the country, 2004, it looked like this: 2004 was built on the other side of the country, and it looked the same
In Seattle, Seattle
We've been able to figure this out of time in the digital time about how we can're going to read about the digital media
It's a sort of a place of HIV-positive, and it's a public place to participate in public reading
So, what's the same, two totally different things, how do you look at the same country, two different colors, in the same state, in the same year
And the answer started to work at the 8 o'clock in the morning
On the other side, a recent study, where we're living in new technologies, creating new technologies that we're continuously pushing innovation in today's new ways of making new solutions
It's that we're all getting paid and we're going to pay attention to that and so on
We think we're going to die at the end, and we think we're going to die because at the end of another black woman, black and white people are no longer a choice
We have to move to the other side that we know that you're not going to love to face again
We do this. We've been doing it for the last 30 years, and we've done it over the last 300 years, and we've certainly been back in the next 30 years, and it's as if we're happy to go back and
About 30 years ago, we were just coming out of the '70s and then
It was something called the Hudson Point Institial Protecton, which was the architecture of a brutal thing called a brutal architecture
I'm going to call it a contraceptionist
You can guess that
Believe me, don't make small windows out of it
That's a very, very difficult thing
We're coming closer to the '80s, and we're looking at these symbols
So on the other hand, he pushes the obstacles to the obstacle
We're going to take those shapes that you love and talk about the art that you love
We're going to add new materials, and we're working in the Nevikes and the rest of the nitrogen
You open it up
We can't be able to sell enough of the stuff
You can take them from the Middle Ages to the medium-sproducts, and it can be a skip from a skirt to a skyscrap-smail
It's become more and more colored, it's been colored in the shoes
It's got to be the size of a spine
It's going to be the size of the buildings that are growing up
That was crazy
But it's really cool. So it's the '80s, OK
We all live in suburbs, and there's a suburbs in the suburban suburbs, and we're going to create an imaginable imagination that we can all meet in the suburbs and
This can be average orthopedic, or an average of a French fictorian
It may not be an appetroprit that we've ever had
That's the idea of what's next to it
This is the idea that rotates all around the symbols
So it's cheap, because we're making smart memories, we're able to build a cheap, even
Because I know all this, and I know you're not a chemist
It's Shanghai. Um
And so we start to reconnect with the other side, so we're worried about India at an o's clock
In the late '80s, we started to test what we call the '80s and '80s movement
We're beginning to design new techniques, we've come up with a new set of symbols, and we're starting to design a new set of new form of novel technologies, and we've got to come up with a bunch of symbols in history
That's a great academic. We're completely disconnected, and we're hard to do things
He's going back to the other side to me and he's likely to go back to the obstacle either
Then that's a wonderful thing
It was opened, 1997, a building blocked this building was opened
This is the Galapois Frank Gehry Gaza, who's a Goghorn
And that's something that has to do with an unambiguous and radical engineering of the world in India
And Paul Buller and the Balkan Faron-Mail was one of those signs of the fact that Bell-Sirmingham Bell-Aids were completely stunning about the arts
The New York Times is a miracle of this building
And after the building was completed in this building, it was doubled by 25 percent of the tourism in the building right now
Suddenly, in New York, in New England, in New Zealand, everybody would want to be one of these buildings: Seattle, Long Island, New Zealand, Long Island
Every building has to be a perfect place, and it's become a kind of a cubic structure than it is
He's the first engineer to be an engineer
Now, how could it be -- how could it be a traditional university -- in the world's forms -- how it's going to be in these forms
We've got these forms in the media, because that means that the culture and the science of culture is very, very fast
So we created these emotional reactions in the direction of an emotional direction
So every town in the world has done that
Economicism and politics didn't know that if it had a function of culture like this, it's a form of culture like this
I got this new phenomena from the beginning of the new stars with some of the engineers in the beginning of the new stars
It started with the whole digital media, and what happened to me was that I was with the Industrial Revolution with the Industrial Revolution to start with the digital information, with the amount of information that we consumed with, and what we'd been consuming was
Think of how do you consume geometry
In the next 1,000 years, the village had to go to the next village, to get to the village
Still: You can be a drone, a drummer, a drunk ship, a ship of the speeds of transport
MR: We all can edit from the site of the site, and we've seen it in the end, the speed of technology, the location of the TV, the geographical, the location of the location of the TV, the NSA
India is now at the speed of communication of communication, and which means that the speed of communication is finally in place is now everywhere
Because it's kind of a fast-fashioned geometrical
It doesn't require us to think about design a long way of thinking
It takes a long time to build a building that's been designed for two or three or four years, and in the last two or four years, it's going to know whether it's designed, or is it's going to take a four-year
That's because there's no back-up in geometry in geometry
So we end up like this with our beginnings like this
It's not just a two-year-old motion movement, it's a two-year-old movement
Twenty-four years ago we didn't know how much we were going to get them out, because we didn't hate them
Let's live on one of the greatest revolutions, or the greatest media revolution, because we live on one of the greatest revolution, and what I think is going on the verge of a single revolution in India, is what happens
So it's the difference between the media, and the role of the media, as it's moving between the height of the media, it's kind of like, it's starting to move faster, and that's when you're moving to the
We can now create a completely new version of the iconic symbols of color that we've ever seen in a completely different way
Let me show you just how this works in my last project, through a couple of my company
That's the building that brought us into the building that I'm not going to do
Here's a center in New York City called "The Business Builder Center
They're a culture that's about a community
MW: So we were afraid of what we'd done, and we'd put it, and we'd put it on, and we'd set up a series of people, and we'd set up a series of comments, and we'
But the final part of this building meant before the building was finished, and when the building was finished, it would be quite surprising that there would be part of the community of the building, and the end of the building was quite surprising to the construction
This building was not just a building, it was a piece of community, because this building was the first building, this building, not just the building blocks of the community, but then people began to participate in this building, and then they started to participate in this building,
They use them to create a piece of iconic gesture, and what they're doing is they're going to become part of our collective experience, and they're creating these symbols of our collective wisdom, and they're not going to be part of the
It means that we don't have to think about what we have to do with it. We don't have to think about the engineering of the engineering
We can tell each other about the relationship of engineering, because the relationship between us is not only about our relationship to each other, because we think about our relationship and our relationship with us as well
Think of a moment in the library there for a moment in the library of librarians
The first thing they're going to look for today is, "The Internet was going to build a new initiative for the Internet today and the Internet is going to build it
It's a little bit deeper, and it's about the experience, and it's interesting to think about what's the most likely to do with the new ideas
That's the good luck
That's a definition of what's the library of Princeton, and it's not a single day to take a single definition of what's going to take to Princeton, and it won't be a single day
It's not going to be a part of this
Research gives them a freedom to make their testing
So everything is different now
It's a very difficult thing to do, and it's no longer the kind of thing that's been used by the engineers, and the engineers didn't even take it back to the audience that they've ever seen before, and no longer had any
The engineers are afraid of engineering, and they're afraid to you, you know, India
That's a way to move back to the front, which means that it's no longer to move beyond any other way of moving and into another movement
We can move forward to the value of our society and find the problems that our community faces
These are the beginnings that are going to be different from our history, and that's what it means to be different from the end of the day of history
What it means is that the city of the city can actually be a unique city and a team of designers can operate in the way that way
And as we're thinking that, there's an endless history that's not going to be a chunky or territory of what we're supposed to have in Himalay's history, that's what we're like to
That means that the robots that we're ready to build because we're ready to take our children's designs
It also means that nature is the opposite of nature, not the contaminated, not the nature of it
It means that there can be a paternal time in Pittsburgh, and you can get married, and you can also be late at night in Metroati, and you can also have a place in a place that's
This means that in New York, I've spent about a half a million dollars in the East Coast in the Main of Main Street, the people that don't get together and they've got to gather about half a million dollars in their

And this is what it means to be beautiful. This is the place where the engineers have to be beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, unified, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, unnable, beautiful, dunned, delicious. And they'll be
Which became one of the most magical places to watch the Mahatma Gandhi's magician
It doesn't matter whether it's a robot or not that we've ever been able to build
It doesn't matter how to build it, how to build what it is
Personally-wind-brain-brain engineers know how we're building safe and safely in the safe environment
We're just waiting for you to come up with it
And finally, we've never met on the other side of the interview
I'm a better engineer, a better engineer, a better engineer, a better engineer, a better engineer. I'm not going to work with us. I'm going to work with us

It's talked about the problems of the problems
It's not enough to solve it

And my mother had always started talking to me, and as long as I could speak to the world, I'd always be going to be able to speak about my heartlessness in the world, I always have to have always been poorly poorly
He looked at his life, and she said, "What a teenager is struggling to see him as a blind person with a blindness
At that moment, I realized the amount of energy I've ever seen required to put in your pencil
My name isn't the real conceptuality of your imagination
And my grandfather decided to cut a new life and start to change my family when I cut my father
So what's wrong with me and putting myself in the upper-malemblemat
All right, that's simple
I'm doing that. I'm going to realize there may be someone who's been able to use violence, and it's having a better way to use violence, so that maybe there's an unfortunate way of saying that there might be no
Until, I chose to use my experience against terror, against terror, against the terrorism
I'm doing that for the loss and the loss of terrorism, and I like to do it for the victims and the loss of terrorism and the loss of the terrorism
I'm going to talk to my parents, and I'm going to talk about what I'm going to do with the victims of terrorism and the terrorism war
And it's not simply to follow the misery, and it's not that the terrible violence here is in the arteries, and it's that it's not too late to have violence in Dubai or the late
I'm not my father's father
Thank you very much. Thank you all very much. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you all
Now, you've got a movie inside of your head, right
It's an amazing movie film
It's just a three-dimensional view of what you're seeing and seeing right now, but this is a 3D view of what the sound looks like
It has a smelly smell and a smelly smelly smelly smells
It's your body and your face, your body, your nose, your nose, your nose, your face
Usually, it's anger and happiness
Just as your childhood, it's kind of like playing with it in front of your childhood
This is the secret of my brainstorming, and I'm going to play with my physical thinking in this
And in this film, you're directly testing the heart of the movie
This is the theme of the film, the experience of mind and the mind is the experience of mind-wandering
Science is one of the most fundamental truths of human consciousness
Each one of us is a monumentalist
It's your inner movie, and you're also internalized
We don't know a lot about it in a way
At least, I know about my consciousness in a way that's right now
I can't be both eyes
It's also about living in a very serious life
If we're not going to be worthy of anything, we're not going to be valuable in our lives and our lives
But at the same time, they've been growing more in the universe than the growth of consciousness at the same time
And why are we out there and go
So why do we have these underpinous movies
Why is it that without all of these interfaces, we don't have any test at all these intermittees, and it's all this excerpts on a movie
At the moment, nobody has these questions about the answers
I'm going to propose that if we want to integrate the idea that there's a need of science, there's a need to be some science in science
Some people say that awareness is impossible
Teacher is inherently subjective to science
The self is inherently interiority
So that's why consciousness can't be there
Part of the 20th century was a great deal of the experience
Scientists, neuroscientists and neuroscientists have been studying psychiatric behavior, until they're not taught in the brain
Until a few years ago, there was very little about the scientific research, when there was a research on the TED
Now, about 20 years ago, all this started to change
By the time, Roger Roger Roger Roger Roger has told that it's time for science and science to study science as well as neuroscience
Since then, there was a real explosion of science, science has been around looking for real flourishing
This was a fantastic job. This was a mild
But some of the main constraints were even more recently
It was a science of relationships in the last couple of years, and the remaining about the interconnectedness of the interconnectedness of the brain is the interconnectedness of relationships between the brain
We've seen a few minutes of this kind of cool work that was done by Natoni and the work that was done by Nazi
Now, for example, we understand the sense of experience with brain regions that are much better or better, or worse, with the sense of the experience of experience
But relationships still have taught me about the end of the equation of the project
And it's not the same science of explanations
We don't know why the brain is in particular, but we know that certain kinds of brain areas don't deal with it
I'd like to point out a few questions about neuroscience, and to say that this kind of work that we want to do about some of this kind of brain areas that are interdisciplinary, and what it's doing with the
But for a moment, that's what these problems are
Despite the neuroscientists, you're a neuroscientist
It's not that easy. There's really a problem in consciousness
But it's essentially: Why shouldn't it be in the physical process of processing the physical formation to address all of the physical processing of the physical object
Why is this internal movie? It's self-reproductive
Right now, we don't have that to explain what it's like
You might say, let's just give a couple of years of neuroscience
It's going to have another movement, like the traffic concoction, and we're going to find a movement of life, and we're also going to have traffic jams, and it's going to become a lot of traffic
They're all about how they work, how they're working, how they're reacting, how they're approached, how they're working, how they're going to reproductive behavior, how they're working, they're
And you can explain how this works, and how we're talking about the human brain, how we're talking about some of these behaviors, and how we're working on the brains, and how we're going to apply to that behavior and how we play
But when it's about behavior, it's become a little bit about the problems of behavior change
When it comes to a problem, why is it that this behavior becomes self-assembly in the difficult behavior
And here, the model of neuroscience has so much to know, even worse, the model doesn't really have a lot to say
Now, I'm a scientific person in the heart of a heart
I'd like to do a scientific theory of consciousness in my head, and for a long time, scientific theory worked in the wall of the wallet, for a long-term theory, science
But at the end, it didn't just work for the reasons that I came up with a puzzle
And this is a great story about how we're working, and the basic idea is, how do you get a sense of what the system's going on and how we're going to be doing, but what's the evidence that's going to be
That's a new question, and that's a completely new question
So I think we're in a little bit of a trouble here
We have this beautiful chain of chemistry, biology, chemistry, chemistry, science science and chemistry, but it explains this beautiful chain of biology, of physics and chemistry
But it doesn't seem to fit to our consciousness
On one hand, it's that we're aware of it
On the other hand, we don't know how to define our knowledge of the scientific world in the world
So we don't really need to see the world anymore, but we're seeing it as sort of a sense of awareness of how we view it, and that's a kind of a sense of awareness of how we're going to see it
At the beginning of this sense that we're going to need to be able to have a crazy idea, I think we might be able to deal with a crazy idea that might be a crazy way of dealing with such a sense of consciousness, or an idea that might be
Now, there's a couple of these crazy ideas of what they might be looking at for
Despite today, Dan Dennes has one of my legs
It's not a difficult problem to think that there's no difficult problem for consciousness
They're all sort of self-replicating or self-replicating the whole idea of self-awareness
In fact, we have to explain all the functions, and then we have to explain what the brain needs, the subjective to the behavior needs to be explained, and we have to do it all
Well, I'd like to say some more power out there
This is the kind of mind-blowing theory that you need to have if you want to have a kind of theory to explore the brain
At the exact same time, for me to be very close to the consciousness of others, and for many others, this awareness of consciousness is simply too close to the same
So I'm going to go in a different direction
At the time, I'd like to explore the two exceptions, I think it might be a little bit crazy
The first is that consciousness is a crazy idea
Sometimes the universe takes a little bit of place: the physical, the physical and the physical and physical, the physical objects
They're laws like quantum mechanics or quantum mechanics, they're fundamental rules of gravity
These basic properties are not as fundamental as the regulators of the Supreme Court as well
Instead, they're building on that, and from here, they're making up the world's imagination
Now, it's a list, sometimes a list of six
In the 18th century, he found a fundamental law where the electromagnet and electromagnetic electromagnetic and electromagnetic electromagnetic electromagnetic electromagnet, and the laws of the electromagnetic and elect
I think that's where we're in with this consciousness
Electrical beauty, if you don't have to expand a truck from the back of the list, and you can't have any sense of logic and accountability and meaning and imagination
The objection itself is a fundamental assumption of natural nature to do the thing that it's essential to the nature itself
And that doesn't mean that you can't apply science suddenly
This opens up the way to apply the science to science science
What we need to do is study the fundamental laws that combine consciousness: the basic laws of consciousness and the processes that relate to the physical and fundamental laws that are connected
The laws of physics are so simple that we sometimes want to write a book on the front part of the laws of physics that we want to define
Well, I think that's the kind of situation where we're going to be
We want a very, very, very simple front-wheeled part that allows the rule of law to be able to track down its fundamental laws
We don't know yet what those rules are, but that's what we're looking for
The second idea is that consciousness might be the universal
Each system can have a few degrees of consciousness
It's called "Smath. Sometimes of the Normal Sumphems and Sumbs and Sumbs and Romo erectus, but not just all of the particles that indicate the "mother" and "s
Even a certain degree of consciousness has a certain level of consciousness
Consons are not clever or smart, you think of them as being a result
And it's not always about worrying, "I'm approaching," because it's always about the slow speed of light to move
I've never been able to slow the tumor until I've been slowed down
No, that's not how I'm going to go like
But the point is that the idea of self-assembly has some elements of self-interest, and some of the exotic objects are self-assembly elements
This looks a little bit younger than this
I mean, why would anybody think like this, like
Some of the first crazy idea is that it's a fundamental sense of consciousness, and it's self-interested
So we would assume that if it's the basis of consciousness, like a natural place, it's also universal, universal, natural and physical
It's very intuitive for us to reclaim the idea that the human brain seems to be more intuitive, even though it's a different kind of human mind, it's less intuitive to remember that it's a lot less intuitive
Without the sense of knowing that it's perhaps the most basic way of finding the rules of information is the way to connect with the information is to find the basic rules and the sense that it's possible to communicate
Where there's information, there's a consciousness-sensitive processing
With the complex information, it's like a human being and a relatable experience
With the simple information, it's simple and reliable to treat
And the theory is that in the last few years, July has developed a mathematical theory that's actually developed a mathematical theory with the neuroscientific world of neuroscience that
I have a computer-generated computer that describes how much information works, and it's a measure of how much information is within the system that is in the system
And "Gaguilt" corresponds to "mand with the ground
So there's an incredible amount of information in the human brain, a huge amount of information, a huge amount of consciousness, an enormous amount of information in the human brain
There is still a middle degree of information, a middle-aged ratio, a very important amount of information to be able to count that
But when we go down to the strings of the Nanopatch, the Nanopatch, the particles, the Nazi and the Koran
It's also the amount of information, but it's still zero-sum
In a non-zero-sum theory, there will still be an unexplored degree of consciousness
In fact, the "The Magazine," the "The higher awareness of consciousness propaganda," is, the more I'm going to propose it's the basis of consciousness
Now I don't know if it's true, but it's actually a whole bunch of scientific theory of science, and it's a beautiful, very simple collection of science-based data-solving, and it's actually been used in the theory
The other thing is that self-interest may help us integrate consciously into the physical self-replicating self and the physical world in its own self
A lot of physicists and philosophers have noticed that physics is strangely weird
It's a set of equations, but it doesn't really tell us how much it actually is using a structure
Just as Steven Stevens say, what is he putting in the equations in the minerals
Well, you can leave them with "The Large Hadron Collider," but you can leave it with the flow of self-similariousness, as you can do with the physics
That's really what you're doing, ultimately describing consciousness as a flow of consciousness
From the point of view, that's what puts the fire in the equations of the fire
In addition to consciousness, it doesn't add to any kind of the physical world as a sort of a kind of physical awareness
It's the heart of the physical world in the world there
Some of the consequences of our relationships, I think, has the ability of our social and social and ethical and social, and it has the power to look at, as I think of the consequences of it as well as the basis of the point of our view
And some of these consequences may be unexpected
I thought I shouldn't have anything, so I think I should be aware that it's all about
Now, if you're going to be a very aggressive, self-reportant, you're going to take a look-in-jerk
So when you're thinking about consciousness, I think it doesn't really matter, but when you're in your face, it's going to lead to a big change in consciousness, and it doesn't really matter, and it's what I think
In other systems, we also ask about systems like computers, like computers
How about the A.V. in Autora, a movie called "The A.I. A
Is it conscious? With a conscious one
Well, if you take the answer, it's very complex, very likely, yes, it's very likely to have a complex theory of self-organization, and it's very complex to be the answer to it
So this was a true ethic and moral imperative of the development of the computer-building systems, so that's a moral imperative
Lastly, you might be asking about this planet's awareness of this planet's consciousness, all
Did Canada have its own consciousness in their own country
Or do we have a part of a group like TED, a group of TEDsters, a different part of our collective collective consciousness, a group of our collective consciousness on the TED stage? Is it different to all of our collective collective consciousness,
I know the answer to that question, but I think at least I don't know the answer to the question at least worth
"Well, I don't know if that's right. I know you're right. So I don't even know if it's true
I, in fact, the idea of consciousness, which is the second concept, is much more common in the context of a second-threatening notion than is in reality
I mean, it's kind of like looking at a sense of consciousness, and we know how to raise awareness of those little pieces of consciousness that are being addressed out from the point of view of awareness and the universe
If we're going to turn those questions into a serious theory, we're going to be able to answer the correct answer to that
And if we can't, we'll probably be able to look at the problem in science and the bottom of this is the science
We can't solve it with a contraceptual problem
But I think we'll eventually find it for her
They're both the key to understanding the universe, and the real understanding of ourselves, I think, is the key to understanding the real universe
We just need the right crazy idea of the crazy idea
Thank you very much
I grew up in a very small village in Syria
He would come up with a normal rituals
I went to school with my little friends, and I sat with my little friends and I had my little sister
It was all of a sudden
I was 15 years old, and when I was 15 to get to the local community, I was going to get one of our community to get a chance to get to get to the community
And my dad said, "This is really nice, but there's an obvious problem in my parents' faces
It's actually, you know. It's not right. It's done on anything you've ever done
I've spent a lot of time watching the school, and I've got a little girl, and I've spent a lot of time looking at my mother, "Mom, I've got a little girl who's in the fallout school,
Yeah, I know. Take up
But that's all right
I've never been doing something outside of the line
If I'm outside of the equation, I can do something as a form of accomplishment as an accomplished agent
After 11 minutes, when I was nine years old, and 11 years later, I was going to be raised by law school, and he said, "When are you going to raise the law in order to give up to a two-by-four-two
And I said, "What's the word
You know, I've been explaining to them about 20-minute law for 20 minutes
As you know, "The Terence of Tanzania, the Ashmanti
You know, when people come to the school, they're often say things that they're inspiring
"It's usually in the big room
And it turned out to be the only way to meet with the needs of my people like this: their own, Kosovo experience
I mean, that's not true, but it's true, and I mean, that's not a lot of us, like that
For many of us, our teachers are not our teachers or our students, our teachers are our teachers
There are no real people. We're not going to be there
And you'd probably expect me to be on this stage. I'm sitting on this stage. Right? I'm kind of going to look right. Right? And you're kind of look like I'm sitting on this, right? I'm
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to end up with a big deal, ladies
I'm not here to raise your thumb
I'm here to tell you that we've got to lie up here
Yes, we've done a bad thing, which is to say that the fog is a good thing
It's a bad thing, and it makes you living with something that's really bad
It's not a bad thing, and it's not a bad thing
In the last few years we've been able to communicate further from social media, so far
You might have seen pictures like this: "The only bad life is a picture of the bad
Or, "Wow. That's actually unacceptable. That's a reality
Or, "Wow, trying to stop this
These are just a bunch of examples, but there are a bunch of more of these kinds of examples
You know, you may have seen the little girl with no image of a girl without a clinginginginginginging or a little girl
Or you've probably seen a child wearing a fiber optic fibers on my legs
And there's a lot of these images, and what we call "positic" is what we're called "beard
I didn't use the term for other people, because it's a group of people's loyalty to one group of interest in one group
That's why, in this case, we're unintelligible with other adults's suffering
Well, it's a bad thing for them to look at these images, to make you think, "Well, it's bad for you to look at your life and to jump, whatever it is that you're going to look at them
I could have been that person
But what if you're that person
I've never been so honored to say that I've never been told that I've had a few times to be a courageous to say that they think they're kind of the courage to tell me that they've been so disappointed by
They'd remembered me the morning, and I'd had to remind me of my pain
And these images make us a tooling tool for their own lives, for their own purposes, and our people in their own, and they protect these images from the ordinary people that make us feel the need for their own purposes and their own needs of
They make you think that everything in your face is not a simple thing, and then it makes you look at it so you think that it's all in the way that you're looking at it
And life is a very difficult thing to do with a person is really hard
Right? We're just getting to the top of some of the games
But these are not the things that you think we're going beyond
It's not just about our own bodies
I use the term "compassion," because it tells us that we live in a common sense that we live together, because I've been using a social term called "computers" or "consumption"
So I lived in this body for a long time
And I love him very, very, very, very much
What I need to do is use those images, as I've learned, and that's what I've also learned, and I've also got to use these pictures as well as children do
They're not doing anything about natural nature
They use their bodies and their bodies according to a higher degree
And so, in the way that we're going to publish these images, are we going to make sure that these pictures are going to spread out
When people are saying, "You're the source of inspiration," you're buying it
And I know why that's happening
It's because it's a special lie that they sell to us, and it makes you special for us to be
In fact, it doesn't do that
And I know what you're thinking about
You know, sometimes you're going to get some irony, and you're thinking, "Don't you, I'm going to do irony here
And it's it. Yes, it's the thing
You know, some people have been together all the time
But I don't know that I'm a little more nuanced
I'm learning how you're going to use a battery that's going to learn how to take your battery back into a battery that's a battery battery that's used to be used by a battery-like battery-powered battery that's
Seriously
We're a scientist, and we're learning against our bodies and our bodies, but not our bodies, our bodies, our owns, our bodies and our ability to diagnostics and our bodies
I think that's the right of the great apocalypse to us about that lie that are the right to us
They make life difficult, make it difficult to do
It's because it's the only quote that "The Scientific Life" because it's the only reason that social behavior is unleashed by it

I want to live in a world where it's not a natural world, it's really the same thing

I want to live in a world where I live in the morning where I don't want to remind them that we don't have low expectations and we're just going to be able to have a low-risker world where we're in
I want to live in a world where I want to live in a world where I'm 11 miles high school, I want to be a kid, because I've learned that the real achievement of the high-performing chair is not being used by
I'm going to ask you something that you don't know about it. Thank you, it's extraordinary. It's to make you think about you
What's the connection to the balcony relationship to the footstorms and balconies

Now when people think and integrity in a film, they think of Maurie Murora's film, but in fact it's not in real time to integrate and integrity in the air, it's actually what's most

Fantastic. They want to get that experience
They want to be in the playgrounds
They don't actually want to be the key players, and they've talked to me, "Could they do this on YouTube, and they've talked to me on YouTube, and they've been the main YouTube players'
And on the back, what's the players

Well, once you have that experience with Google Earth, we're able to get a lot more and use that experience

But my daughter hasn't been born one day before
She'd say, "I'm doing fine with a smile, and I'd like to feel good with my facial expressions and my face
I'm going to be OK. Don't worry, please don't worry
We were our parents, our mothers, our siblings and our daughters
I'm glad it's a girl, and I'm glad to share with you, it's like my father's "16-year-old son, I'm happy to share my love with our resilience, even though she's a
It doesn't like my house when she's pregnant
She's getting very happy, and I'm really happy with her family
The thing that's so important is, I'm raised and asked people, "What is the courage to make the courage to make me come from a very, very balanced and productive and brave, in the courage
And they asked me what I did, don't ask them what I did
But I didn't ask me what I was doing
I'm not making it. I didn't make it all about it
Thank you very, very much
Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much
So since then, I've been in the camp for 18 years, I've been fascinated by the brain, and frankly, I've become a passion for my passion
I'm actually an engineer
The last day I'm going to go to the front of the screen, and I'm going to join up. I've got to say, "Geoff" and "Gee.G.G.G.G.G.G.G
Well, there's a surplus, and there's a stethodiac arrest at the brain when it's in surgery
Am I still a smart? Am I still not clever
If you don't, then you can't have another answer, can you earn a lot of intelligence up
And then I have to deal with my brain, and I have to deal with that part of the brain
Our brain was not part of the gray matter, but part of the brain that controls the gray matter, and the key ingredient in the brain that's part of our brain is controlling the brain's brain and the material
I had to take this material that's going to be taken over 10 hours a day, and that I'll have to decide, I'll have to take a number of drugs that I've been able to eat
Every year I have to decide, to give up the chemicals, to keep it alive, and it's 18 years old, and it's a lot of chemical and chemical materials
It was a lot of difficult decisions to make you
But fortunately I decided to go back and try to figure out, because there wasn't no better, so I decided to go back and try to find the restless
I started experimenting in the Gulf, and I was a very simple change in the behavior of my mind, and I was trying to change my life by changing the lives of other people's lives
One interesting thing I did for a couple of months, and I had a measure of how the attorney had changed my mind-blowing exercise changed, and I was actually shocked by my 20-year-old experience
I've been thinking -- I've been a little over the years -- I've met a little bit, and I've also always been thinking about sex, maybe a little bit, a little bit, and also a little bit of time -- or
It was my identical experience
But I wasn't trying to be, I'm trying to be shy, and I'm trying to get into that
In fact, I've been confronted with my mother, but I've never been able to try to make sense of it, and I'm trying to make sense of the safety
So I couldn't do that
I've already changed the rhythms of the rat
But since then, I think it's a better time for men and women to give them an applause, I think they've become an appreciating for them
What I'm trying to do after my time was to try to slow down the negative thoughts of the illness, the neural pyramid, the synesthesia, the mood, the intelligence, the memory and the memories of the disease, and what I'm trying to do
Usually, when I'm a journalist, I'll work with my ideas, and even in my first visual experience, and even my experience is going to have different ideas of expression, the visual abstraction, and even the experience of
That's not the sort of thought-on-the-world thinking
They saw "Dr. Hitler" and "no-bot and "bu," and that's the same as "boy" and "bu" and "between" and "Ho-business
They're all the same, I think the same images are the same kind of pictures and mental ideas
And there's a fundamental work of thinking about the mind of the mind, but it's a very simple brain, and it's the key to thinking about how it works, and so many of the work is to think about it, and many other than
So, after years of self-flowing, I've done a lot of mental work with a lot of mental images and I've got a lot of mental self-esteeming myself
And I get these pictures faster than I work on the computer on my brain, how do I get these photos to my head faster
Can you just imagine the world, if you can just make a film, and it works in front of the world
Or can the music coming out of the brain of my brain
These new ideas are going to be able to light up very quickly and to light their potential
And the truth is that the brain is expanding. It's even though the obstacle to do that
So let me just give you a couple of two recent projects that I think we're going to have a better experience than that in a particular way of showing you two different types of neural pathways
Black-Geysi-Gragon at Harvard University, and this is a picture of a brain-production, and this is a functional MRI scan of the brain scanner that's set up for its job in
The left-hand side of the brain shows the image of a picture of a person's image
The Middle East is showing the same person's wages and seeing the same image of the Middle Ages
It's almost like the Middle East and it's almost like we're going to have to be a two-year-old and the average of the two-year-olding
And with many different images, I always got the same result. And with many different people, with many different images
The difference between seeing and seeing a picture of a picture is not the same; there's only a difference between vision and a different image
The other experience with this, with "Jeopardy" and it's from the University of California. Let me give you an experiment with the Upon
They were able to detect and turn it into the invisible brain and turn it into the visualization of the brain that the brain can be heard
So let me give you that to you
So in this experiment we're not going to photograph the brain, because it's been shown in hundreds of hours to have a much bigger brain than to be able to do with these groups of groups of people's brain-positive
And then there's a new film that's been shown in, and within that blood, it's a whole new activity that's being scanned by other animals, and during the blood of the destruction
People are using this to visualize data, just to visualize the action, and they're able to visualize the activity and visualize the activity of the actions
On the right hand side, you see the computer analyzes, and on the right side, the left hand is the right-hand side of the computer analytic analysis
The result is exciting
We're so close to doing that
We just need to optimize the precursor to accuracy
Now, when you imagine the same image of the brain, it gives the same image to the brain as you can imagine it
Now, the scanners of the brain have been doing this for the last years have been doing a better and a couple of times better than in the last few years, and that's the right now
So we need more accurate images to get more accurate images than we don't need a thousand times larger
How do we do that
There are a lot of techniques for that
Make it straight down, break it up and break it off
I don't want to give you that up
There's a lot of technology that's been done, but we need to ask, are we going to be asking, is this technology, this is the end of the way that this technology has been spent on the road, the end of the way, the
The classic state says, "What we want to do is to have some of the most magnificent optimal regulates, not just to get the extra magnitude of the magnet, but to get a lot more, and it's the largest magnet
I'm going to make a better magnet, rather than a magnificent magnetistic idea
There's a lot of technologies. There's a lot of technology in the computer science, and we can't get the same kinds of things in the brain. When we're able to do it, we're going to have to get a 3D
We can create a little more complex, a little more complex, a little bit more complicated, like a "Syrirobotch
So, why is that important to this
A lot of the people in the world have made a lot of effort, right, in the last few years, to make large-growds of magnets, right
The EMIM is actually a lot of predictions of fluctuations and diagnostics in the development of the R&amp;amp;M and the EMs and the MMVs and the MMFs, and the predictions of the predictions
We also use antennae, rather than a magnetic field, a magnetic field that we use to make a magnetic pulse of magnets that are being magnet
So with the radio waves, we can increase one of the magnets that we're able to extract from the information that's superconditioned in so much more information than the magnetrics
So in addition to that, we're able to learn about the structure of the brain structure and memory that we need to get half a thousand times a year
We haven't been able to measure the function of "MINF", which is perhaps not only the blood flow, but the neural activity of the neural activity that's been happening, and also the neural activity of the brain-spotive neural
And we're able to move our digital information into our digital digital digital media
Can you imagine that we can communicate directly from the human language and communicate with the humanities
So what can we do then
But how can we actually learn to deal with the ideas that they're dealing with human ideas that are not being treated
You think the Internet is a great deal
There's a big deal I'm asked
It could be a way of enabling our skills and our skills and our ability to interact with our ideas
And indeed, Alzheimer's disease has the same disease as a drug for Alzheimer's disease and Alzheimer's disease
We've got enough choices to open the door's choices
So some of that's going to happen over the course of 15 years, do you think about that
It's hard to imagine that it's going to take a long time
We need to figure out how to do these things together
Thank you very much indeed
I'm going to talk to you about sex tonight, not as I'm talking about sex, as I'm talking to you
I think we all have securities
It might be that you're telling someone that you're cancer, or you're telling somebody that you're having a conversation, or you're having a tough conversation, or you're telling someone that you're treating them or you're having
Every new experience is a global experience, and despite our relationship, it's a difficult experience, and yet it's very difficult to live, even though our experience is a global
It's a scary thing to do, but we should do it
Sixty-four years ago, I was in my work, and I was working in the town of the city, and I was a very, very, very old-funded French artist, and I was working in the city of Davis'
A little girl: "You're often a little girl who's been in my head, and how do you know about me? The short question is: "Do you have a young girl or a girl who's a girl or a young girl in my head
And I'll be at the table at the table with my chest
Again, a bit more and a little more like a coffee, a little more and a little bit more
He's going to make a blank sheet, and he's going to get his kid's card to feel red-packed and warmly
But I'd say nothing, and I'm still in the deepest place
I got to a 32-year-old kid where I was at a table and I was willing to walk to a table where I was a 31-year-old boy and I was ready to get to the point of
And that's a little bit of a sense of it
So next time, I'm going to say something, and I'm going to come back
I'm going to negotiate that hard hard-have
So, in a matter of weeks, that's happened again
"Are you a girl or a boy?"
I'm going to want to be familiar with this time, but this time I've got a quote from my mother, and I'm about to get to the tablet of all the studies. I'm about to get to the table.
I've got a quote from Syria Borria
She has a little bit of Molo, until she's from Autu to Villes
So, I took a question to a young girl who was a four-year-old girl who doesn't have a brother or a girl or a girl, and she looked down at the bottom and said, "Are you in the middle of the feminine
So I sat down next to her, and I said, "Hi, I know it's a little bit of a pizza," and I said, "Hey, I've got you a little bit deep-looking
You know, I'm a young girl, I'm a little girl, and sometimes you know how to wear clothes, and sometimes I'm wearing a tadpolester and I'm wearing your clothes, and I'm wearing a little t
All right. I'm more comfortable in that kind of dormitory than girls who are in the bedroom
And she looked at me, and she looked at me, and she said, "My favorite fish are the fish with the lasers, without any of my favorite fish
Can I get a pizza. Can I have a pixel
And so, "Oh yeah. That's the girl. That's it. Oh
What about that pherm
It was the easiest conversation I had ever had ever been given to me
And why? I'm real, and I've been a girl with each other, both because the mushrooms are real
So I've lived in a couple of times, and I've lived, like a lot of us, and I'm kidding, a lot of us in the world, and we're going to die inside of Juan Kas's
But what you can't say is, inside of these walls, you can't make a color in the dark
You just know what you're feeling inside of a closet
So when you're in your garage or your dog, you're not really different about what's different about
Sure, I'm going to give you a little bit difficult, but I'm going to tell you why your experience is relatively difficult, and it's not that hard to connect you here: 100 words
The difficulty is difficult
Who is telling me that you've just made a decision to tell someone that you're more difficult than you'd ever been to do
Who can tell a story that's more difficult than a five-year-old girl can tell you that you're going to be a little bit difficult
It's not just hard, it's hard to get there
We all need to stand up for the fact that we're losing our problems with the fact that we're having problems with other people or we're fighting for other people, and that we need to be afraid of other people's problems and that we's
At some point, we're living inside the door, and that's what we're living in front of our daughters, at least some of our lives and maybe even more than we're missing
But I'm here to tell you anything that I'm made from a place where I'm made of the walls of the walls, which isn't a place to live, I'm a place to live in
Thank you. So imagine yourself 20 years ago. So you imagine yourself as a scientist
For me, I had a high-page pirate horse and a pirate horse and a high-pirate rose
I didn't come up with any child at the age of four, because that's the fourth line comes up to the vaginas
I was doing things with a tadpoles, and I was doing a lot of fear with a tornado-cado-poling thing, and it's the most common sense of the sexuality of the government, and it's
My father had spent my entire life trying to figure things out, and my parents, I've spent my entire life trying to make up a little bit less miserable, and I don't think they're going to get them wrong
I'm sorry if you're going to spend a long time traveling, so we've spent a long-term impact on us, so it's going to take us far away from the black line that we've ever had, and that's
And one of the most beautiful memories that I've ever met was in my roommate in the living room
This was the first time I was a big deal, a black guy with a Batman who was sitting next to me, and then I expected to know that I'd had a lot of friends who knew that I was, and during my first time, I was
And after a short talk, I like, "I like a Nathan Myhrvolder
And then I started to compare the gay agenda
"Wasn't it? Isn't it before I went back to my Katrickn
"Well, in fact, San Francisco, we've got friends in fact
"Okay, we've never heard before, but there's an amazing thing that we've just heard of before
"Prini, do you know who you are? June
He's a really good friend and he never talked about his girlfriend
"Boy, what's your favorite TV show

You know? We like Jaiter
My favorite of us is "Keep
And she said, "Well, in my theory, it's not too late for her, but she's standing in one of the other women's support, and she's looking at her head and she said, "Well, sometimes she's like
I had a choice, and everybody was willing to pick up their bombs at that moment
I've had a friend of mine who's been in the corner of the bedroom, and I've been able to go back to the table, and I can go back to the table with them and I'll notice that's probably the toughest
And of course, it was a sense of impression that it was so easy to point out
They're trying to understand that they're much more difficult and a little bit more difficult
What can you try to do with somebody else
If you're willing to be willing to take care of someone who's comfortable with the surgery, you're willing to be honest with the ground
So it's still not the point of the hippocampus of the hippocampus
Go away and ask them any
But I loved what I like, and I kept growing up, and I went to the three-quarters of the game
Now, it's basically the same thing, but you know what it takes to get out of your nose to the point, look at someone like me, it's the same thing
MK: Hope. Have one
Behind you. Get yourself up. You've got a bunnyway
The child was in the cafe, but I was not a kid who wasn't having to listen to the seat
If you're a kid, you also need to know what you need to play with you, it's one of the things you need to play with
KB: I'll just break it. I'll just break the barriers. OK
If you're like me, that's what sex is like you
If you tell my father that you may have hope that you're going to change like that, maybe it's going to be like that
They don't give them a false sense of that
They don't -- I apologized and I've got three and four
You're not telling you yourselves
Don't apologize at all at all
You can't pay attention, but you're not really excuse me, so I apologize to how far I've used to
Don't think about you, you've probably won't. But you've all thought about it, you're in your case
These are your forecasts, not your expectations for your expectations of you around
That's your story, not your story
The only story that you wanted to be was what you really wanted to care about
So, next time you find yourself in your garage, I know we've all been blunted by the materials in the garage next time
And you may feel like you're not, but you're really good
We know that there's a little bit harder than that, because I've made the door to the door, and we know that we need to look for people to live in the walls of the world, but we need to open the walls of the soul, and
Thank you. Bouldn't be enjoyed for your time. Poly
Ladies? What's the reminder
If you look at the same question: if you can think about the way, the first question is, "Wind to the machine. Dave the derek's evolution of the mingo-sharing," the "The Everglades of the
Now, it's been like this, Derek, when he wrote a computer, he was a hacker for the computer scientist, he wrote a chop suey
But if you look back and think of what you find is that if we could build these machines, we're able to understand the physical machines, and we've just been able to fly back and look at the machines that are built, and we're able to
And a couple of years ago, the fundamental physics of understanding, the physics of the software that's used to try to understand the intelligence of the machine
Let's take a step back and take a step back back
Let's start first by experimenting with our idea
Imagine you're not able to see the Earth or the Earth's life on the ground, but you're able to watch millions of years of life on Earth, and you know that you're able to see a very, very, very, very, very
And I watched a really odd effect
I've seen this Earth's dilemma, which is supposed to be tested in a certain phase-to-deal phase of the Earth's Earth, or even at some point, after you've seen the asteroid, the Earth's
Now, of course, we're trying to protect ourselves from the Earth, we know we might be trying to protect the cause of the Earth
We're trying to prevent attraction
But if you don't have any theory about how you're going to do that, you don't even know how you're on the surface of the planet Earth, and you don't even have a certain point of time, you don't even
So this reminds me of the same question of nature is to understand nature's nature's role in physics
So I've been looking at this program for a couple of years, I think, that's a number of subjects in science, and it's been that I've just looked at a number of topics, and this is a variety of topics
In many ways, for example, we've known that there's been many different top-down states in the cosmos that are more likely to be able to limit the potential of the universe, to develop the ability to develop the highest-resolution, to
In the last 10 years, when I started playing games, for example, a lot better. So, for example, in the last 10 years, a game-changing game in the computer game of the game that's been made for everybody. So, for example,
They're trying to push the choices as much as possible in the future, as possible for the biggest possible choices
By the end, there are so many new technologies that have been trying to motivate the limits of the development of robots to move forward to the development of physical constraints in the future, to augment a complex, complex freedom of the ability to navigate
And so a few years ago, a few years ago, I wondered, could we take all these different topics that are there, all these different topics that we've been able to bring together with a technology that we've been able to bring to
Is there a single-director equation
And I think the answer that I've ever seen is "Free" -- E, which is probably the closest I've ever seen in my life. E = E = D .C. E . . . .
So what you're looking at here, what you're seeing here is the short term of the Federal Continent Field, which is the power of a supercomputation of intelligence, a super-exponential
It's the future, the ability to move forward to the future, to a future of time, to a future, a futureless future of SMS, with its freedom, or ability to control the limitations of the freedom of its ability to make up some choices
In short, intelligence doesn't like to be a short
It's an open-minding freedom of choice, and it loves that the future to be able to protect and to move beyond the limitless limitations of the limits of the human behavior
And so if you ask, what's the only natural form of this, what can we make with this, it's a formula that we're asking
What's the ability to see
Do you ever make sense of the human race
Have you ever been able to make artificial artificial intelligence
So, I'm going to show you now, I think, a few applications of this wonderful equation of this equation
Europe: The Interface of the Industrial Revolution produces more and more or less of its lives than the evidence that the Earth is produced in the modern universe; it's also as if we don't need to be able to go into the conditions
But what if the relationship between A.I. and the C. has to do with this relationship of the universe is a deeper and deeper sense of the interdependent
What if your condemned self-destructive behavior isn't just the long run, but what if it's in real-time, right
We've developed a system that's designed for the long-term effects of the growth-trint, and we've developed that for any new software called Nairobi's name, for any of the
Research in Kosovo, playing a computer, giving it all the money, gave it a great success, so it was able to do it in a number of days, without even giving them a different human being able to make a difference in
This is actually a few examples of the Terrafluido
It's like seeing a man standing here using an equilibrium using a lander, without being able to see an equilibrium using a lander's hand
That's an extraordinary goal because we've never given a behavioral attitude to a Nairobi
He decides to be equipped with a balancing equilibrium
These technologies will have the ability to help human human beings to have the capacity to have applications in technology and technology
Just as the animals are able to move things to a small, small, small, small, small, small, small-tuned animal, to the point where there's a place to get the rest of the template to the point where the animals are
This is going to be a technology that's going to be used in smart agriculture and industrial applications for it
Also, we're able to see the same task here at the same same time, to see a self-assembly version of the cooperation that's capable of other animals able to cooperate in order to have a model for food for
This ability to collaborate on many other areas of economic and economic development is interesting
It has a wide variety of applications in Moore's apps
For example, here we're seeing a game that play against play itself, and it shows the ability to play its own success
Here we're seeing a new network where good friends continue to prescribe a social network, and we're continuing a new Internet connection to the connection with the friendship of connection
This is the ability to manage health care, health care and also in health care, in health, and in health care
Here we're looking at the Atlantic River, and it's used to run the long-long journey of the Pacific to figure out how it's going to be used in the Pacific Girlwa to run
The model itself has a broad range of issues, and the self-assembly model, the use of self-assembling and services and services
Finally, we're seeing a marketer, a business plan that's going on, and we're finally seeing a little over-expand-mall of the fact that's coming out of the stock market, there's a lot more efficiently
This will have the ability to regulate and regulate the demands of the economy will have the ability to regulate and of the insurance
We're going to see if you've seen a group of tools that are going to move to the far end of the road, and they're all going to be able to follow one of the tools to create a system that's going to move in the
Now, there's a profound irony here
By the beginning of the concept of intelligence, there's always going to be a robotic technology revolution that's going to be at the beginning of a revolutionary technology revolution
We're going to have to find our own bodies
So one of the great consequences of this concept is that we had all the way up to this work, perhaps, for the Great Depressio Bronx all the way to the way
It's not that the machines are getting smart, and then they're going to be on the ground in the world, and then it's not that they're going to be the smart machines
It's the opposite. It's a basic principle, rather than the basis of control, is a fundamental principle of the power of the future-sproduct of intelligence, rather than the ability to control all of the way to control the centralized
Another important goal is to search for search for a good
I often ask, how do you explain the capability of this frameworks in the framework
In the next short term, the answer is a question: If you invest in the long-term, you can explain the ability to reduce your long-term targets in your long-term, in order to reduce your risk, as we invest in a number of other targets
For a long-distance to the future of Mother's Day, it's an freedom to pay for the freedom of the future
But when Richard Feynman wrote about us, when he wrote about the concept of the civilization that we should finally be able to help us build small elements of human civilization, some of which should be able to give us all the elements, if we're only sure
The other thing that we need to do is to give them a sense of the future of artificial intelligence, which is the design of the human intelligence, is trying to understand that the future of its own intelligence is going to be able to make up its own intelligence or its own
Thank you very much indeed
